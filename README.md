# Plasma-Compiler âš¡

C compiler written in Python. It does not comply with any standards for the C
language. Likely Turing complete. It works by transpiling C source to x86
assembly, then leveraging third party tools to assemble and link the program.
The code is fully custom, everything from the lexer to the code generation (no
libraries used).

NOTE: This project is complete and further development has been moved to
https://github.com/BluBloos/Portable-Programming-Language

# Steps for Using

NOTE: The compiler only runs on Windows host machines, and it will only compile
win32 binaries.

This project uses the MSVC linker, so you will need to install <a
href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio</a> if you haven't
already. At the time of writing, the latest version is 2019, so I cannot
guarantee proper linking for any subsequent versions. Also note that if your
Visual Studio version is different than 2019, you will need to change
*shell.bat* accordingly.

In addition, this project uses Netwide Assembler (<a
href="https://www.nasm.us/">NASM</a>). Install the binaries and make sure the
bin directory is set in the system environment variables.  

Finally, some Python dependencies must be installed,

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use the compiler, open a new command prompt and run,

```
shell.bat
```

This will setup the MSVC environment, so that link.exe is accessible.

To run the compiler for a novel program, run the following,

```
python compiler.py <fileName>
```

Plasma Compiler will compile the file, run it, and display the result of the
program to the console window.

To run the pre-made tests:

```
python test.py
```
